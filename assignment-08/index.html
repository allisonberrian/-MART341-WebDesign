    <h4> Lyrics </h4>
    <p> I can't say that you don't hurt me anymore<br />
I haven't changed enough to make me think I'm what you're lookin' for<br />
And I can't be the fix for what you're goin' through<br />
Maybe I'm not the same me, but you're still the same you</p>

<p>So you don't get to know what I do with my time<br />
You don't get to say you ain't doin' alright<br />
You don't get to come around sayin' that you want me now<br />
You don't get to show up with that look in your eyes<br />
You don't get to think that you can take it all back<br />
You don't get to miss what you said we never had<br />
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn<br />
After all you put me through<br />
No, you don't get to<br />
You don't, you don't, you don't<br />
You don't get to</p>

<p>Did you come back 'cause I didn't break enough?<br />
Did you hear that I was happy? You just had to mess it up<br />
Or is it just some phase you're always goin' through?<br />
To want what you can't have and leave it when you do</p>

<p>So you don't get to know what I do with my time<br />
You don't get to say you ain't doin' alright<br />
You don't get to come around sayin' that you want me now<br />
You don't get to show up with that look in your eyes<br />
You don't get to think that you can take it all back<br />
You don't get to miss what you said we never had<br />
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn<br />
After all you put me through<br />
No, you don't get to<br />
You don't, you don't, you don't<br />
You don't get to</p>

<p>You don't get to kiss me and make it all better<br />
You don't get to lay it all out in a letter<br />
Blame it on somethin', break me like it's nothin'<br />
Just to love me back together<br />
You don't get to show up with your hair hangin' down<br />
Move a little closer like you're movin' right now<br />
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn<br />
After all you put me through<br />
No, you don't get to<br />
You don't, you don't, you don't<br />
You don't get to<br />
You don't get to<br />
You don't get to </p>
