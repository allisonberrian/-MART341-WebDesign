        <div class="second-paragraph">
            On a spring evening in 2009, in a campus parking lot at Duke Univerity, I was lying on the floor of my van, trying to hide from view. This is it, I thought. They know.

            Often we hear about another’s tragedy, and it makes us feel better about our own situation. This is quite
            different from what the Dalai Lama was doing. He was not contrasting his situation with others, but uniting
            his situation with others, enlarging his identity and seeing that he and the Tibetan people were not alone
            in their suffering. This recognition that we are all connected -- whether Tibetan Buddhists or Hui Muslims
            -- is the birth of empathy and compassion.

          I was wearing nothing but boxer shorts , splated out on the carpet, face up, like a scarecrow toppled by the wind. My arms and legs took up pretty much my whole central living space: the section of the van between the bed in the very back and the driver and passenger seats up front. Next to my head was my three-drawer plastic storage container, which, in addition to serving as my founter for cooking, held pretty much everything I owned: Stacks of cereal boxes,bags of rice and beans, and a jumble of miscellaneous items, including sewing supplies, utensils, duct tape, and recycled Ziploc bags.

          It was a sunny day. As on all sunny days it was far hotter inside the can than it was outside. It was unreasonably hot. Scalding hot. Africa hot. The van was a moist 98°F womb, and I, a red-faced fetus wishing for a orifice to wriggle out of Betweeb the North Carolina hear and the very realistic possibility of they knowing aboutmy secret, my glands thought it was a  good idea to discharge all reserves of sweat, darkening the hue of my underwear , imprinting a moist outline of my body onto the carpet, and encasing me in a slick film of perspiration.
        </div>

            Moments before, when  I'd get caught a glimpse of the vehicle  that had parked next to me, I'd been cooking my evening meal on an isobutane backpacking stove on top of my storage container. As soon as I saw his car throughmy window, i pulled the blinds down and turned off the stove and flattened myself on the floor. It was a security guard's patrol car.
