    <h1> About Nancy Shaw</h1>

<pre>
I gobbled up books when I was growing up. I loved Half Magic, My Father's Dragon, Uncle Scrooge Comics, and many more.
We didn't get a TV until I was almost finished with third grade.
My family played word games on the long car trips we took, so I enjoyed fooling around with words.

I studied English literature in college and graduate school.

I'd been intrigued by picture books for a long time, but reading to my children made me much more tuned in to them.
My daughter and son loved silly stories. We were on a dull car trip in 1982 when I tinkered with animal rhymes, which turned into Sheep in a Jeep.
Sheep on a Ship, Sheep in a Shop, Sheep Out to Eat, Sheep Take a Hike, Sheep Trick or Treat, Sheep Blast Off!, and Sheep Go to Sleep have followed.
