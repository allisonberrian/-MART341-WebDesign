#Week 9
1. Learning HTML has been very new to me! I had to reference sources to complete assignments!
2. I am excited to see how it all comes together! I am anxious to try and remember everything!
3. The challenges I overcame were trying to really understand the small errors I made and where they were. It took a lot of careful edits to fix some problems!
