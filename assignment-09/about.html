  <h1> Why This Project? </h1>
  <p> A few  years ago, I crashed my Jeep and decided to learn how to rebuild it myself. My dad working in autobody all his life, walked me through the process step by step. It was such a fun and unique experience.
  <div id="meaning" class="container">
<h2> Meaning </h2>
<p> This project has a lot of meaning behind it for me. It gave me an opportunity to appreciate a paint job on a vehicle. It also gave me time to realize how much work my dad does on a daily basis. <b>The most important part of this project was the time I got to spend with my dad. </b> I also learned the responsibility of fixing something I broke.
