                Childhood
                  I was born and raised in Snohomish County Washington. I was an athlete who spent all her time around the sport of soccer. I constanly had to be doing something and took pride in my work ethic. Growing up I was absolutely obsessed with capturing photos and videos and creating memories I could look back on and remember the details. I was always picking up my moms camera and taking pictures at my brothers game and then I got a phone and would be constantly taking picures and videos. Looking back and remembering the small details so vividly brings back so many memories and will put a smile on my face.I liked giving others those memories as well.

                  Associates Degree in Integrated Studies
                  I always had different career paths through high school and community college where the only degree I could get was an Associates in Integtated Studies because I took everything from math and science to business. Finally realizing I enjoy writing and have fallen in love with the University of Montana, I randomly did a process of elimaination and decided to major in journalism.

                University of Montana Journalism Graduate Fall 2020
                Hating it at first, I then refound my passion for media and all it brought. I love the behind the scenes work into how stories get told. I learned the struggles in putting your grades and future in the hands of your sources and working to gain their trust so you could do the work you needed to and they could open up how the story best reflects them. I found how rewarding producing a story from another perspective can be and I have found how much more knowledge and detail I gain when I fully understand a story of another to produce it.
