### Week 4
- Web browser work by the network providing the rendering engine the requested document. The rendering engine reads the html to construct the content tree (DOM). The CSS documentation is passed by the engine as well to create the styling associated with it (CSOM). This creates the render tree combining the to processing the layout of the page. The web browser I use mostly is Safari. I sometimes use Chrome.

 - Mark up language creates the text you see on the page. The one commonly used in development is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). It is used to interpret and compose text, images, audio and other content.

  ### Week 5
  - I went to umt.edu.The site was very compact with visuals all over the place. There are less pages and fewer buttons to click to navigate the page.
  These last few topics have been a bit challenging trying to get everything to connect together. I feel like a few set backs have allowed me to better understand what I am doing.
